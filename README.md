# Heart_disease_prediction
In this project, machine learning models were deployed on the dataset which contained information about presence of heart disease in the patient, to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not. After importing the data, data visualization techniques were used for the purpose of data exploration. Categorical features were then encoded and other features that required feature scaling were scaled. Three machine learning models namely K-Neighbor Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and Random Forest Classifier were then deployed on the dataset. The parameters were then varied in each model to achieve best scores. Finally, K-Neighbor Classifier model achieved the highest accuracy score of 87% with 8 nearest neighbours. In order to use the information gained in this study in real life practice, a GUI application was made using tkinter of python which takes in parameters required to predict the heart disease in a patient from the user and then either congratulates him if that person is unlikely to have a heart disease or warns him if that person is likely to have a heart disease.
