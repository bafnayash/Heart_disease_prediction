# Heart_disease_prediction
In this project, I applied machine learning models to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not. After importing the data, I used data visualization techniques for data exploration. Then, I scaled features other than categorical features by creating their dummy variables. Later, I applied 3 machine learning models namely K-Neighbor Classifier, Support Vector Classifer and Random Forest Classifier. I varied parameters in each model to achieve best scores. Finally, K-Neighbor Clssifier model achieved the highest accuracy score of 87% with 8 nearest neighbors.
